The top portion of the weather dashboard displays current weather data, whereas the bottom half of the dashboard features a 5-day forecast. Below is a breakdown of the specific data featured on the site.

Current Weather Tracks:
    1. Temperature
    2. Humidity
    3. Wind Speed
    4. UV Index

5-Day Forecast Tracks:

Lastly, users have the ability to enter as many cities as they so choose and click on formerly searched cities to re-display city-specific weather data.
